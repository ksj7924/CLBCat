    and these transitional blazars, or the possible transitional blazars 
    between the standard FSRQs and BL Lac types (EW-based classification);
    even also including the red or blue (quasars) blazars;
    and broad line BL Lac types sources.
    


Note: 

    Dear professors, experts, readers, and potential beneficiaries:
    
    The CLB Catalog is compiled manually, may have bugsï¼Œmany shortcomings, 
    and leave a lot to be desired. Better suggestions,
