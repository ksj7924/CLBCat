# CLBCat
A Changing-Look (Transition) Blazars Catalog (CLB Catalog) is compiled by Kang Shi-Ju.

    https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9071-5469

Note:


    In the Changing-Look Blazar catalog, partial, including but not limited to, 
    the confirmed Changing-Look Blazars (CLBs), the predicted CLBs; 
    and these transitional blazars, or the possible transitional blazars 
    between the standard FSRQs and BL Lac types (EW-based classification);
    even also including the red or blue (quasars) blazars;
    and broad line BL Lac types sources.
    


Note: 

    Dear professors, experts, readers, and potential beneficiaries:
    
    The CLB Catalog is compiled manually, may have bugsï¼Œmany shortcomings, 
    and leave a lot to be desired. Better suggestions, 
    more clues (references) are welcome to continuously improve the catalog.

    We again sincerely invite you to provide better suggestions and more clues (references) 
    to continuously improve this Catalog.

    Best,
    
    Thanks very much !
    
    your Sincerely

    Shi-Ju  Kang on behalf of the coauthors
